This project is created by Shantanu Verma(2016CS10373) and Manas Meena (2016CS10379) as a part of the project-1 of course Design Practices in CS(COP290). This files gives the instructionto compile and use the project.

Instrcutions are following.

1) Open the 2D to 3D or 3D to 2D whichever you want to run according to your need.
2) After opening the folder run the makefile by typing "make" in terminal (for both the folders) and then "./proj."
3) For using 2D to 3D.

	3.1) After running the previous command, you will be required to enter the vertices and edges in the terminal itself. After correctly giving the vertices and edges dependency an OpenGL window will open which will show you the 3D object generated from the 2D description given by the user.

	3.2) The 3D description of the object is stored in a text file.
	
	3.4) Use Arrow Keys(<-,-> etc) to rotate the object.

	3.5) Use 'j' key to show/hide axes, and 'k','l' to toggle Window and toggle view.

4) For using 3D to 2D.

	4.1) Following same steps above, after running "./proj" an OpenGL window will be opened.  

	4.2) Use 'o','p' keys to zoom in/zoom out of the view.

	4.3) Used keys 'w','a','s','d','q','z' to move the cube/pointer around and ']' to bring pointer back to origin.

	4.4) Take help of the grid to draw 3D objects, but if you don't want to see the grid or you're finished drawing the object press 'g' key to view/hide the grid and Arrow keys(,-,-> etc) to rotate the objects/ view.

	4.5) To draw an object, bring the pointer to the first end of the line you want to draw, and press '[' and then move to the other end where you want to draw the line press ']' again and a line will be drawn.

	4.6) Use keys 'e','r','t' to view the front, side, top views respectievely, projected to the corresponding plane on the grid/axes.

	4.7) Use keys 'j','k','l' as mentioned above.

5) Some more keys/Instructions.

	5.1) Use 'Esc' key to exit the window/program.
	
	5.2) Right Click anywhere on the window to open a Menu which tells you which key perform which operation and also cliking on each item will perform that operation for you.
